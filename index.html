          I had visited this lovely place in 2016.

        <p class="text-muted">Sydney Opera House was added to UNESCO's World Heritage List in 2007.
 
          There are more than 1 million roof tiles covering approximately 1.62 hectares sitting over the structure. They were made in Sweden.
           
          Seven A380s could sit wing-to-wing on the site.
           
          Sydney Opera House was opened by Queen Elizabeth II on 20th October, 1973. She has since visited four times, most recently in 2006.
           
          When the Sydney Symphony Orchestra is on stage in the Concert Hall, the temperature must be 22.5 degrees to ensure the instruments stay in tune. Temperature and humidity are critical to musical instruments.
           
          Arnold Schwarzenegger (former actor and Governor of California) won his final Mr Olympia body building title in 1980 in the Concert Hall.
           
          A net was installed above the orchestra pit in the Joan Sutherland Theatre during the 1980s following an incident during the opera Boris Godunov. The opera featured live chickens and one bird walked off the stage and landed on top of a cellist.</p>

          I had visited this lovely place in 2022.
        </h5>
        <p class="text-muted">When I was in Australia I visited Brisbane and I thought it was a lovely city. I loved the Queen Street Mall which is an outdoor street that has been closed to cars and is only open to foot traffic. Then all you have to do is walk across the bridge to get to South Bank which I also loved. In South Bank there is a very big park/green area, there is also a lovely archway that you walk though which is covered in flowers that takes you to the man made beach which I also liked. The city is big enough to have most of everything you want. Actually if you find a job you like there and settle down then really you have no reason to go to Sydney other than occasionally if you want to go to one of the events Sydney or New South Wales has like Bathurst.

          Then of course with Brisbane you have the Gold Coast only around 1 hour south by train away or you can drive there which you can easily nip down to for a weekend away to the extremely popular tourism spot. You also have the Sunshine Coast only about the same drive away if you head north.
          
          Compared to some other Australian cities like Melbourne it has very very mild winters. In my opinion Brisbane is one of Australia’s best cities. I was very impressed with the place when I visited.</p>

        <h5 class="text-success text-capitalize">
          I had visit this place very often and is one of my personal favourites.
        </h5>
        <p class="text-muted">It is friendly, clean, beautiful, the weather is really pleasant, the restaurants are amazing.

          There is so much public transport and so much to do,
          
          Melbourne is a place to visit for sure!For those of you who aren´t Australian then a trip down to Melbourne is worth it. Melbourne may not have all of the tourist glamour of Sydney (i.e. it does not have famous harbour) but it has friendlier vibes than Syndey. It has culture, cafe / al-fresco culture to be precise, making the city feel more european and far less sleazy.

          As a city of 4 Million it has many attractions some of which include: Carlton and the Italian eateries in the area, Southbank and the new areas along the Yarra, the live music scene in Fitzroy and Richmond (to name a few).

      <p>The Emoji Movie exceeded my expectations in every way possible! As someone who loves animated films, I went into the theater with a mixture of excitement and apprehension, unsure of what to expect from a movie centered around emojis. However, I was pleasantly surprised by the creativity, humor, and heart that this film had to offer. The animation was absolutely stunning. The vibrant colors and attention to detail brought the world of emojis to life in a visually captivating manner. From the bustling city of Textopolis to the exciting adventures within various smartphone apps, each scene was a visual treat that kept me engaged throughout the film.</p>

        I can't believe it! I think the animation team made a wonderful job. Settings, costumes, objects, hairstyles, color palettes, etc., are stunning. The character building is pretty interesting. As a viewer, you won't be disappointed of seeing their growth. Violet, the main one, is always in touch with life stories - surely, we've all lived one of this at least once-. The characters are charismatic, they make people laugh and cry. You feel sorry for them and you bond to them through their own pain. The narrative takes the time of including past moments -and characters- of the own story, which is a quite nice detail (do not mean about Violet army flashbacks, but the stories told in the anime). I believe this story is well written; it's not oversaturated with a lot of events and meaningless actions, but rather has its rhythm and leads us to the the climax. It mixes emotional elements. They acheieve to manipulate -in a good way- the viewers so they can feel full satisfaction while the whole story is told.
        
        Finally and most important, I feel gratefull for this warm trip to different ways of love.</p>

      <p>
        'When Marnie Was There' may not be one of Studio Ghibli's best films ('Princess Mononoke', 'Spirited Away', 'My Neighbour Totoro', 'Castle in the Sky', 'Whisper of the Heart' and 'Grave of the Fireflies).

But even when Ghibli are not at their best they still produce films that are better than most studios at their worst, while 'Tales from Earthsea' is from personal opinion their weakest effort it does have enough to make it watchable still. 'When Marnie Was There' drags a little at times particularly in the first half an hour or so, which is somewhat aimless, and some of the supporting characters could have been much better fleshed out.

These flaws aside, 'When Marnie Was There' is still a real charmer, and ranks possibly around higher middle of Studio Ghibli's filmography. Its best assets have to be the animation and the music. The animation is simply wondrous, the colours are both atmospheric and ethereal, all the characters are appealingly drawn in distinctive Studio Ghibli fashion and the backgrounds are exquisitely detailed and gorgeously idyllic, was also really impressed by how Anna's facial expressions conveyed so much. The music is incredibly beautifully orchestrated and sears with emotion , nostalgia and atmosphere, often appropriately gentle and sometimes melancholic. "Fire on the Outside" is genuinely moving as well, not mawkish or over-sentimental at all.</p>
